      "The Future of the Web - Reinstalling the Big Missing Feature of the Web"
    </h2>
    <p>
      The California Software Professional Association (www.cspa.com) hosted us
      to speak on the Future of the Web. We've been discussing how the lack of
      annotations is making the web static. This has made internet platforms
      treat people and information as commodities. But do we accept a future
      where we are working for technology rather than the other way around? A
      better future of the web is possible. With The Overweb, we are building
      the next level of the web - a trust layer over the webpage, enabling
      people to have layers of knowledge and interactions on web pages. The
      first Overweb applications were Mosaic and Netscape (beta) in 1993-1995 as
      well as modern annotation pioneers Hypothesis, Diigo, and Rap Genius.
    </p>
    <p>
      The emergent Overweb is anchored by an open-source blockchain called the
      Overchain that enables:
    </p>
    <p>a) participants to own and control their annotation data and</p>
    <p>
      b) decentralized applications to serve interactions over the web page.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both of which feed AI on the edge that exposes misinformation and
      catalyzes collaboration on regenerative solutions for the worldâ€™s greatest
      problems. RSA Fellows Daveed Benjamin and Joshua Armah presented the
      unknown history of web annotation, the case for The Overweb, The Overweb
      pattern, and the open-source blockchain-based tools they are developing.
